        Wolverine has spent a good chunk of his time doing things that he would later regret. 
        Even though I would consider him more of an anti-hero, he has spent a lot of extremely long life trying to right his wrongs. 
        Anyone who believes in redemption is a winner in my book. Logan saw himself as a weapon, a killer, an animal.
        But I give a ton of respect to him becoming a hero and suppressing that feral side on him. 
        Something else I can add to this is that he never gives up. 
        Despite all the wrong he has done, he hasn't given up trying to be good. 
        He also has a cool design and isn't afraid to kill unlike other superheroes.
